**Genetic Algorithm for Epidemic Mitigation**

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05377.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05377.pdf)

This algorithm uses [genex](https://www.github.com/seanmor5/genex) and [libgraph](https://github.com/bitwalker/libgraph) to create a genetic algorithm for limiting the spread of disease in a social network.

The algorithm produces a list of edges to remove from the network. These edges represent connections---essentially the algorithm tells you which edges will effectively mitigate the spread of infection.
